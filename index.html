			<p>If you want to have a personal aesthetic, then we have to start with the basics: what an aesthetic actually is. ... As a noun, aesthetic describes 
			“relating to the enjoyment or study of beauty” and as an adjective,
			it connotes to an “object or a work of art is one that shows great beauty”.
			Aesthetics covers both natural and artificial sources of aesthetic experience and judgment. 
			It considers what happens in our minds when we engage with aesthetic objects or environments
			such as viewing visual art, listening to music, reading poetry, experiencing a play, or exploring nature.
			The philosophy of art specifically studies how artists imagine, create, and perform works of art, as well as
			how people use, enjoy, and criticize art. Aesthetics considers why people like some works of art and not others,
			as well as how art can affect moods or even our beliefs. Both aesthetics and the philosophy of art ask questions
			like "What is art?," "What is a work of art?," and "What makes good art?"</p>
