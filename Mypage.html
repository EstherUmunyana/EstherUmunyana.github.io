<p><h1><u>'Still I Rise’.</u></h1><br> <em>This wonderfully self-assertive poem</em> about picking yourself up and striving to achieve,<br> even in the face of adversity, was used for an advertising campaign by the UNCF in the US,<br> but its message of selfhood and determination is one that should be heard by all. It’s the perfect place to begin exploring Angelou’s poetry – and <br>the ideal poem to head our selection of her five must-read poems.<br></p>

<p><h2><i>‘Phenomenal Woman’.</i></h2> Being <strong>a ‘phenomenal woman’</strong> is not about being a certain size,<br> or a particular shape. It’s about how you carry yourself, and how you behave. As with several other poems on this list of Maya Angelou poems,<br> ‘Phenomenal Woman’ is about being unbowed, about holding one’s head high and being proud of who one is.</p>
<p><h3>You may write</h3><br> me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

<p><b>Does my sassiness upset you?</b>
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.<br></p>

<p>Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.<br></p>

<p>Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?<br></p>

<p>Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own backyard.<br></p>

<p>You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I’ll rise.<br></p>

<p>Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?<br></p>

<p>Out of the huts of history’s shame
I rise
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br></p>

<p>I rise
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise.</p>
